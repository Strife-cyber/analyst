# Offline Data Analytics Platform

This project is an offline data analytics platform designed to enable users to analyze large datasets without needing a constant internet connection. It supports secure data storage, processing, and visualization, with synchronization features to update data when the internet is available.

## Features

- **Offline Functionality:** Analyze data without an internet connection.
- **Data Synchronization:** Syncs with cloud sources when connectivity is restored.
- **Data Ingestion:** Import data in various formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).
- **Data Processing:** Perform data cleaning, aggregation, and transformation.
- **User Interface:** Intuitive UI for querying, visualizing, and reporting on data.
- **Localization:** Multi-language support and regional preferences.
- **Security:** Encrypted data storage and secure handling of sensitive information.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter:** For building cross-platform mobile applications.
- **SQLite (sqflite):** Lightweight, serverless database for offline data storage.
- **Dart:** Programming language used with Flutter for building the app.
- **TLS:** For secure data transmission during synchronization.
- **AES-256:** Encryption for storing sensitive data securely.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [SQLite (sqflite)](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/offline-data-analytics-platform.git
   cd offline-data-analytics-platform
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Set up the development environment for your platform (iOS, Android, or Web). You can follow Flutter’s official [installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

4. Run the app:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Architecture

### Data Storage

- **SQLite (sqflite)** is used for storing and querying data locally on the user's device.
- **sqflite ORM** abstracts SQLite queries, providing a type-safe API and supporting real-time updates.

### Data Synchronization

- Periodic background syncing ensures the platform syncs data with a cloud server when the internet is available.
- Conflict resolution strategies are implemented to handle changes made offline.

### Data Processing

- Heavy data processing is performed using Flutter’s `compute` function to run data transformations in isolated threads.
- Columnar storage formats like **Parquet** and **ORC** may be used to store and process large datasets efficiently.

### User Interface

- The platform’s UI is built using Flutter, with widgets like `DataTable` and custom charts for data visualization.
- Offline status indicators and real-time query updates provide a smooth user experience.

### Security

- Sensitive data is encrypted using **AES-256** encryption.
- Secure authentication and role-based access control ensure user data privacy.

## Usage

Once the app is installed and running:

- **Import Data:** Import datasets in CSV or JSON format.
- **Query Data:** Use the built-in query tools to analyze your data.
- **Visualize Data:** View visualizations like graphs and tables.
- **Offline Mode:** The platform works fully offline, syncing data when the internet is available.
- **Export Data:** Export results and analysis in various formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).

## Localization

The app supports multiple languages and regional preferences, such as date formats, currency symbols, and number formatting. The language can be switched dynamically based on user preferences.
